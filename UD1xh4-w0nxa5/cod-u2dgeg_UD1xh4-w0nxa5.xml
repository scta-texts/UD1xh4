          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>In my two last ser 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>mons I entreated  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>of true faith and ye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>effectes therof, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>among the rest in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>one place I sayde,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>that the Articles  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>of the Christian faith are as it were a  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>briefe Summarie of true faith: now 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>therefore I thinke it to be not beside  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>the purpose, and part of my duetie, to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>laye before you those twelve Articles 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>of our beleef. For they are the substance  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>and matter of true faith, wherein  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>faith is exexcised: which because it is 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>the ground of thinges hoped for, heere  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>is plainely ad briefely declared in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>these Articles what thinges those are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>that are to bee hoped for. But let no  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>man at this present looke for at my

          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>hand the busie and ful discourse of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>Articles of our faith: I will but briefly  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>go through them touching onelye the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>most necessary points. They are in an  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>other place handled more at large by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>severall partes. Pray ye with me to ye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>Lorde, that he will vouchsafe to shew 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>to us his waies, to guide and preserve  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>us in them, to the glorie of his owne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>name, and the everlasting salvation of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>our soules.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>First I have to say somewhat tou 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ching the common name whereby the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>Articles of our faith, are usually cal 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>led the Symbole or Creede of the A 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>postles. A Symbole is as much to say 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>as a coferring together, or els a badge.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>The articles are called a conferring 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>together, because by the laying to 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>gether of the Apostles doctrine they 
          <!--56.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="56"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>were made and written to be a rule &amp;  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>an abridgement of the faith preached  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>by the Apostles, and received of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>Catholike or universal Church. But  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>what hee was that first did thus dis 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>pose and write these articles, it is not  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>knowen nor left in writing of the ho 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>lie Scriptures. Some there are that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>doe attribute it to the Apostles them 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>selves, and therefore do call it by the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>name of the Apostles Creede.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/><name>Saint Cyprian</name> the martyr in his ex 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>position of the Apostles Creede, sayeth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/><quote>Our auncestours have a saying, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>after the Lordes ascension, when by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>the comming of the holye Ghost the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>fiery tongues sate uppon every one of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>the Apostles, so that they spake both  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>divers and sundry languages, where 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>by there was no forreine nation nor 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>barbarous tongue to which they see 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>med not sufficiently prepared: to 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>passe by the way they had a comman 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>dement from the Lorde, to goe un 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>to all nations to preach the worde of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>GOD. When therefore they were in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>a readinesse to departe, they laide  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>downe among themselves a platforme  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>of preaching for them all to followe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>least peradventure being severed one 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>from another, they should preach di 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>vers things to them that were conver 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>ted to the faith of Christ. wherefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>beeing there altogether and repleni 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>shed with the holie Ghost, they ga

          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>tence, aud made that Breviarie (as l 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>said) to be a patterne for all their prea 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>chinges to be framed by, appointing 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>it for a rule to be given to them that

          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>Apostles owne making or no, or else  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>that other the Apostles disciples made  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>them, yet this is very well knowne,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>that the very doctrine of the Apostles  
          <!--56.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>is purely contayned and taught in the.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>These twelve Articles are called also  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>a badge, because by that signe as it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>were by a badge, true Christians are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>discerned from false. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>Nowe I will declare what order  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>I will use in expounding them unto  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>you. This whole breviarie or abridge 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>met of faith, may be divided into foure  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>partes, so that the three first parts may  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>make manifest the mysteries of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>three persons in one godhead: and that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>the fourth may lay foorth the fruits of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>faith, that is to say, what good thinges 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>we look for by faith, &amp; what good things  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>God bestoweth on them that put their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>trust in him. And yet this notwithsta 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ding I wil proceede herein, even order 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>ly so, as the twelve Articles are placed  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>or set downe.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>The first Article of Christian faith  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>is this, <quote>I beleeve in God the father al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>mightie maker of heaven and earth.</quote> 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>And this first Article of the Creede con 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>tayneth two especial poyntes. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>first wee say generally, I believe in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>God. Then wee descende particular 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>ly to the distinctiou of the persons and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>adde, The father almightie. For God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>is one in substaunce, and three in per 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>sons. Wherefore understanding the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>unitie of the substaunce, we say plain 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>ly, I believe in God. And againe, kee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>ping and not confounding the persons  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>we adde, In the father almightie, In  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>Jesus Christ his onely sonne: And in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>the holy Ghost. Let us therfore believe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>that God is one, not many, and pure 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>in substaunce, but three in persons,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>the Father, the Sonne, and the holie  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>Ghost. For in the lawe it is written,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/><quote>Hearken <name>lsrael</name>, The Lorde our God is,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>one Lord.</quote>  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>And againe in the Gospel wee reade  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>that the Lorde saith: <quote>Baptise them in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>the name of the father, of the sonne, 
          <!--57.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="57"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>and of the holie Ghost.</quote>
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>By the way this is singularly to bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>marked of us, that when we pray wee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>say, Our father which art in Heaven,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>give us this day our daily breade: but  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>that when wee make confession of our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>beliefe, wee say not we believe, but I  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>believe.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>For faith is required of every one  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>of us, for every particular man to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>have, without dissimulation in his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>heart, and without double meaning  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>to professe it with his mouth. It was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>not enough for <name>Abraham</name> to have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>faith for all his seede. Neyther wil it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>avayle thee any thing. for an other to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>beleeve, if thou thy selfe art without  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>faith. For the Lord requireth fayth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>of every particular man for himelfe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>Therefore so oft as wee confesse our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>faith, every one of us by himelfe doth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>saie, I believe. But what it is to be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>lieve I have declared alreadye in my  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>fourth Sermon. It followeth in the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>Confession, I believe in God. God is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>the object and foundation of our Faith,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>as he that is the everlasting and chief  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>goodnes, never wearie, but alway rea 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>die at our neede, We therefore believe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>in God, ye is to say, wee put our whole  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>hope, all our safetie, and our selves 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>wholly into his handes, as unto him 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>that is able to preserve and bestow on  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>us all thinges that are requisite for  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>our behoofe.
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>Nowe it followeth that that God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>in whom we rest, and unto whose tui 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>tion we doe all commit our selves, is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>The Father Almightie. Our God is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>therefore called Father, because from  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>before all beginning hee begate the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>sonne like to himselfe. For the Scrip 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>ture calleth GOD, <quote>the father of our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>Lord Jesus Christ. He,</quote>  sayeth the A 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>postle, <quote>is the brightnesse of the glory 
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>of GOD, and the lively lmage of the  
          <!--57.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="57"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>substaunce of the father: to whom he  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>saide, Thou art my sonne this day have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>I begotten thee.</quote> And againe, <quote>I will be  
         <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>his father and he shall bee my sonne.</quote>  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Also God is called father in respect of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>the likenesse that hee hath with our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>earthly father, to witte because of our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>Creation, the favour, love, good will &amp;  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>carefulnesse, wherewith he is affected  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>towardes us. For God hath created  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>us, God loveth us: God regardeth our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>affaires and is carefull for us, yea and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>that more exceedingly too, than anye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>earthly father is. For sayeth <quote><name>David</name>,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>Even as the father pitieth his children,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>so doth the Lord pitie them that feare  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>him, for hee knoweth our estate, re 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>membring that wee are but dust.</quote> <quote><name>E 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>saias</name></quote> also in his 49. Chapter saith, <quote>Can 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>a woman forget her owne infant, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>not pitie and bee faine over the sonne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>of her owne wombe? But admit shee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>doe forget, yet will not I forget thee.</quote> 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>In this is declared Gods good wil to us  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>warde : and we confessing that GOD 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>is our father, doe also professe that God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>to us is both gentle, liberall and mer 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>cifull, who wisheth us all things that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>are availeable to our health, and pur 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>poseth nothing to us warde, but that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>which is good and wholesome: and last  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>of all that at his hande wee receyve,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>what good so ever wee have, either bo

      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>God is called Almighty, because by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>his might he can doe al things, because  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>he is Lord of all thinges, and hath all  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>thinges subject to his commaunde 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>ment. For the same cause also is hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>called the Lorde of Hostes. Heaven,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>Earth, and whatsoever is therein, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>Starres, all Elements, Men, Angels,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>divels, al living Creatures, all things  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>created, are in the power of the most  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>high and everlasting God. Whatsoe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>ver hee commaundeth that they doe,

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>nothing is able to withstande his wil. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>What he will, that, must of necessity  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>be done:and also these things he useth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>even as his owne wil and pleasure is,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>and as his justice and mans salvation 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>do require.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>First wee confessed that God doeth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>will us well, and nowe wee acknow 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>ledge, that whatsoever he will that he  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>is able to bring to passe. For wee saye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>that God is Almightie, that is, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>there is nothing, but he ca do it, which  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>is profitable and necessary for us men,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>as he that is Lord of al, and our strong  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>helper. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>But that God is our good father, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>liberall, gentle, mercifull, strong, Al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>mighty, Lord of all, and our defender 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>and deliverer, it is to bee seene by his  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>wonderfull works. For he is the ma 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>ker of heaven and earth. And in the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>making of heaven and earth, hee hath  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>declared the great love that hee bea 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>reth to mankinde. For when as yet  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>they were not, neither were able with  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>desertes and good turnes to provoke  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>God to doe them any good, then God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>first of his owne meere and naturall  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>goodnesse, made heaven &amp; earth, a most

          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>gave it them to dwell in, putting un

          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>of this whole worlde. But how great 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>power he shewed in the making of all  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>these things, it is evident by this, that

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>mazed at the good will and power of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>GOD. And yet by the way we must  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>thinke the Creatour of all thinges to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>be such an one, as by his sonne, that is,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>by his eternall wisedome, hath crea

          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>which every thing would presently fal

          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>herein therfore confesse also the provi

      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>And thus in this first part I have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>declared unto you that which is pro 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>per to the father. For hee is a father, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>yea hee is the father of our Lorde Je 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>sus Christ, and our father also, beeing  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>Lord of all thinges, maker of heaven &amp; 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>earth, governour and preserver of all  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>thinges, by whom all thinges are, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>in whom all things consist. Who from  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>before all beginning begot the eternall  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>sonne, equall with the father, being of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>one substaunce, power and glory with  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>the father, by whom also hee made the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>world: From both them proceedeth ye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>holy Ghost, as <name>David</name> witnesseth and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>saith: <quote>By the word of the Lord the hea 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>vens were made, and by the breath of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>his mouth al the host thereof.</quote>  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>Now followeth the second part,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>wherein are contayned all the myste 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>ries of Jesus Christ our Lord ye sonne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>of God. For the second article of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>Christia faith is thus word for word:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/><quote>And in Jesus Christ his onely sonne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>our Lorde.</quote> This article also compre 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>hendeth two things. The first is, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>wee believe in the sonne of God: The  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>second what the sonne of God is. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>wee confesse that wee believe, that is,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>that wee put our whole hope and con 
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>fidence of life and salvation, as well  
          <!--59.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="59"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>in the sonne as in the Father. And  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>therefore we say plainely, I believe in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>Jesus Christ: even as before we saide,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>I believe in God. &amp;c. For the Lorde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Jesus himelfe in the 14. Chapter of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/><name>John</name>, sayeth: <quote>Let not your heart bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>troubled: ye beleeve in God, beleeve  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>also in me.</quote> Againe, <quote>This is the worke  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>of God, that ye beleeve in him whom 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>hee hath sent.</quote> And againe, <quote>This is e 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>ternall life, to know thee the true God  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>onely, and him whome thou hast sent 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>Christ Jesus.</quote> 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>Moreover in the Gospell after <name>S. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>John</name> we reade that the Lord speaking  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>to the blinde whose eyes bee opened,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>sayde: <quote>Doest thou beleeve in the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>sonne of God?</quote> And that the blinde ha 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>ving received his sight aunswered : 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/><quote>Who is the Lord that I may beleeve in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>him?</quote> wherunto the Lord replied, <quote>Thou  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>hast seene him, and hee it is that tal 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>keth with thee.</quote> And that then againe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>the blinde saide, <quote>l beleeve Lorde</quote>, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>therewithall he worshipped him. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>Therefore let us also believe &amp; wor 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>ship, let us believe that Jesus is the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>verie sonne of God the father, being  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>of one power with the father , al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>though in person hee differ from the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>father. Which <name>David</name> testifying,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>sayeth: <quote>The Lord saide to my Lord, sit  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>thou at my right hande, &amp;c</quote>.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>But if we declare at large, who that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>sonne of God is in whom we believe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>then must we note three thinges espe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>cially. The first is that hee is called the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>Onely Sonne. If he be the sonne,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>yea and that too the Sonne of God,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>then is his nature and substaunce, a  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>divine nature and subssance. Signification:  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>For in this sanctification doeth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/><name>the Apostle</name> call him: <quote>The brightnesse of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>the glorie of the father, and the lively  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>image of his substance.  </quote>
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>Very well therefore doe the holy fa 
          <!--59.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="59"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>thers saye, that the Sonne is of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>same substaunce and beeing, with the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>father. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>Whereunto belongeth that, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>hee is called the onely sonne, and in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>an other place the onely begotten and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>first begotten sonne. For wee also  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>are called sonnes, not by participation  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>of nature, or likenesse of substaunce,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>or naturally, but by adoption. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>And therefore the Jewes were not 
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>offended because hee called himselfe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>the sonne of God, in that sense that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>all the faithfull are called, and are the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>sons of God, but because they did per 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ceive that he did more extoll himself in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>saying that he is the naturall sonne of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>God, equall to God, and God himselfe.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>For thus wee reade in the fifth of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/><name>John</name>. <quote>Therefore the Jewes sought  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>the more to kill Jesus, not onely be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>cause hee had broken the Sabboth, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>but saide also that God was his fa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>ther, and made himelfe equall with 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>God.  </quote>
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>Againe, where the Lord in the tenth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>chapiter sayde: <quote>I and my father are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>one, then the Jewes tooke up stones to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>stone him withall: But Jesus aunswe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>red, Manie good workes have I done.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>unto you, for which of them doe yee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>stone mee?</quote> To which the Jewes re 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>plied: <quote>For thy good workes sake we 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>stone thee not, but for thy blasphe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>mie, &amp; because thou being a man ma 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>kest thy selfe God. </quote>
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>Thes are most evident testimo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>nies of the natural Godhead of Christ,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>which whosoever beleeveth not, hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>hath not the Father. For heo that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>honoureth the sonne, honoureth the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>father : and hee that is without the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>sonne hath not the father: and unlesse  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>the sonne were GOD by Nature,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>hee coulde not be the saviour of the

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>Now the second thing that is to be  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>marked is that the name of the onely  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>begotten sonne of God is opened, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>he is called Jesus Christ. The name is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>expressely set downe, ye we may knowe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>who it is in whom we believe, lest per 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>adventure we might be deceived in the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>person. It is Jesus: which name was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>given unto him by gods appointment  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>from heaven, even as also it was pre

          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>high priest. <name>The Angell in the Gospel</name>

          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>and thou shalt call his name Jesus. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>hee shall save his people from their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>sinnes.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>So then this sonne of God Jesus is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>the saviour of the worlde, who forgi

          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>the power of our adversarie the divell.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Which verily he could not doe, unlesse

          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/><quote><name>Christ</name></quote>, which is all one as if you say,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>Annointed. The Jewes call him <quote><name>Mes 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>sias</name></quote>. Which worde is a title proper to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>a kingdome or priesthoode. For they  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>of olde were woont to annoint their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>kinges &amp; priestes : they were annoin 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>ted with externall or figurative oint 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>ment or Oyle. But very Christ was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>annoynted with the verie true oynt 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>ment, that is, with ye fulnes of the ho 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>ly ghost : as is to be seene in the first  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>&amp; third Chapters after <name>S. John</name>. Most  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>properly therefore is this name Christ  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>attributed to our Lorde. For first, he is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>both kinge and priest of the people of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>God. Then the holy Ghost is powred  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>fully by all meanes and abundantly  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>into Jesus, from whom as it were by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>a lively fountaine it floweth into all  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the memders of Christ. For this is that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/><name>Aaron</name>, uppon whose heade the Oyle  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>was powred, which ranne downe to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>his bearde, and the nethermost skirtes  
          <!--60.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>of his garment. For of his fulnes we  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>have all received.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>The last thing that is to bee noted  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>nowe in this second Article is, ye we cal 
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>the son of God our Lord. The sonne of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>God verily is for two causes properly  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>called our Lord. First in respect of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>mystery of our redemption. For Christ  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>is the Lorde of all the elect, whome he  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>hath delivered from the power and do 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>minion of Satan, sinne and death, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>hath made them a people of his owne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>getting for himselfe.  This similitude  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>is taken of Lordes, which with their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>money buy slaves for their use, or else  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>which in warres reserve captives,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>who they might have slaine, or which  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>deliver men condemned from present  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>death. So then by this, Lordes are as  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>it were deliverers, redeemers or savi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>ours. Hereunto verily alludeth <name>Paule</name>  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>where he saith: <quote>Ye are bought with a  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>price, become not (therefore) the ser 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>vaunts of men.</quote> And <name>S. Peter</name> sayeth:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/><quote>Yee are redeemed not with golde and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>silver, but with the precious bloud of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>the unspotted Lambe.</quote> Moreover 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>Christ is called Lorde in respect of his  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>Divine power and nature, by which  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>all things are in subjectio to the sonne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>of God. And for because this woorde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>Lorde is of a very ample signification,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>as that which conteyneth both the di 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>vine nature and majestie, we see that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>the Apostles in their writinges use it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>verie willingly. <name>Paule</name> to the Corin 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>thians sayth: <quote>Although there be many  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>Lords, yet have we but one Lord Je 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>sus Christ, by whome all thinges are,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>and we by him. </quote>
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>Now the third Article of Christian 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>faith is this, <quote>Which was conceived  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>by the holie Ghost: borne of the Vir 
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>gin <name>Marie</name>,</quote>  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>In the seconde Article wee have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>confessed that wee believe in Jesus  
          <!--61.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="61"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>Christ the sonne of God our Lorde:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>wherein we have as it were in a sha 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>dow confessed, that we beleve allured 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>ly, that God the father hath for us and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>our salvation, given to the worlde his  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>sonne, to be a saviour and Redeemer 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>For hitherto belong those names, Je

      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>Now therfore in this third Article  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>I have to declare the maner and order  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>how he came into the world: to wit,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>by incarnation. This article contay 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>neth two thinges. The conception of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>Christ and his Nativitie. Of both  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>which I will orderly speake , after  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>that I have briefly declared unto you  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>the causes of the Lorde his Incarna 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>tion.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>Men were in a miserable taking,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>and all mankinde should utterly have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>perished for sinne, which wee have all  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>drawne from the first man <name>Adam</name>. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>the reward of sinne is death. And for  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>that cause wee that were to bee cast in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>to hel, could not enter into heaven, un 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>lesse the sonne of God had descended,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>unto us, &amp; becomming God with us  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>had with himelfe drawne us into hea 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>ven. Therefore the chiefe cause of his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>incarnation is to bee a mediatour be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>twixt God and men, and by interces 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>sion to joyne or bring into one, them 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>that were severed. For where a me 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>diatour is, there also must needes bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>discorde and parties. The parties are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>God and men. The cause of discorde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>is sinne Nowe the office of the Me 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>diatour, is to bring to agreement the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>parties disagreeing: which verily can 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>not bee done, unlesse that sinne the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>cause of this variance bee taken cleane  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>away. But sinne is neither cleansed  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>nor taken away, except that bloud bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>shed and death doe follow. This wit 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>nesseth <name>Paul</name> in his 9. Chapter to the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>Hebrewes. The mediatour ought
          <!--61.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>therefore to take on him our flesh  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>bloud, that he might both die and shed 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>his bloud.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>Furthermore it is needfull that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>this Advocate or mediatour be indiffe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>rently common to both the parties,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>whom he hath to reconcile: wherefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>our Lord Christ ought to be very God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>and verie man. If hee had beene God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>alone, the should he have been terrible  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>to men, and have stoode them in little  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>steede. If he had beene meere man, then 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>coulde hee not have had accesse to God  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>which is a consuming fire : wherefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>our Lord Jesus Christ being both God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>and man, was a fit mediatour for both  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>the parties. Which thing the Apostle  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>witnessing, saith: <quote>One God, and one  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>mediatour of God and men, the man 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>Christ Jesus who gave himelfe the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>price of redemption for all.</quote> The  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>same Apostle in the 2. and 9. Chapter 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>to the Hebrewes, speaketh manye  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>thinges belonging to this place. And in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>the second Chapter, rehearsing an o 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>ther cause of Christ his incarnation,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>he saith: <quote>It became him in all thinges  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>to be made like unto his brethren that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>he might bee mercifull and a faithfull  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>high priest in things concerning God,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>for to purge the peoples sinnes For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>in that he him selfe was tempted he is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>able to succour them that are temp 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>ted.</quote> An other cause wherefore our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>Lorde was incarnate, was, that hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>might instruct us men in all godlines,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>&amp; righteousnes, &amp; finally that he might  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>be the light of the world, and an ensa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>ple of holy life. For <name>Paul</name> saieth. <quote>The  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>grace of God that bringeth salvation 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>hath appeared unto us, teaching us to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>renounce ungodlinesse, and to live ho 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>lily.</quote> To conclude, he therefore became  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>one with us by the participation of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>nature, that is to saye, it pleased him  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>to be incarnate for this cause, that he  
          <!--62.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="62"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>might joyne us again to God, who for  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>sin were separated from God, and re 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>ceive us into the felowship of himelf,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>and all other his goodnesse beside.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>The next is for to declare the man 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>ner of his incarnation. This article of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>faith standeth on two memders. The  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>first is, <quote>He was conceived by the holie  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>Ghost.</quote>  All we men, Christ excepted,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>are conceived by the seed of man which 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>of it selfe is uncleane, and therefore we  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>are borne sinners, and, <name>Paul</name> saith: <quote>We  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>are borne the sonnes of wrath.</quote> But  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>the bodie of Christ, I saye, our Lorde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>was not conceived in the <name>Virgin Ma 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ry</name> by <name>Joseph</name>, or by any seede of man,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>but by the holy Ghost: not that the ho 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>ly Ghost was in place of the seede. For  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>nothing is begotten of the spirite, but 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>what is spirituall. Neyther hath our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>Lorde a phantasticall, but a very true  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>body, and of the same substaunce with  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>us. So then our Lorde was concey 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>ved in the wombe of <name>the Virgin</name> by the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>holy Ghost. For the holy Ghost by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>his eternal power did bring to passe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>that, the virginity of the mother being  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>uncorrupted, shee, I say, being made  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>with childe, conceyved of her bloude,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>and gave a pure and very humane bo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>die to the sonne of God. As is decla 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>red at large by the <name>Angel Gabriel</name> in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>the first Chapter of <name>Saint Luke</name>. Of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>which place I meane to speake else 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>where more largely, I doe now passe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>it over untouched.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>God him selfe streight waies after  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>the beginning of the world did foretell,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>that such should be the manner of that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>conception. For he sayde not, the seede  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>of the man shall tread downe the Ser 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>pents heade, but <quote>the seede of the wo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>man.</quote> Moreover the Lorde by the Pro 
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>phetes sayth: <quote>I will raise up seede to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/><name>David</name>.</quote> But <name>Moses</name> law for the raising  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>up of seede to the brother departed is  
          <!--62.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>well knowne. For if the brother dyed  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>without issue of children, his brother 
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>remaining alive, was copelled to mar 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>rie the diseased brothers wife, and of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>her to beget children, which were cal

          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>because, god so working, she of her own

      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>The causes why this conception of

          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>He that is conceived in the wombe of

          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>any uncleannes in it selfe.  An other 
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>cause is this, God came to cleanse our

          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>of us men, hee himselfe verily ought

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>This article also is divided into his

          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>tastically to the appearance onely, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>that he suffered verilie the calamities

          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>termen, and death it selfe in most bit 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>ter panges. He suffered therefore both  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>in soule and bodie, yea and that too in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>many fashions. For Elaias saith: <quote>He

          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>Secondarily in this article is noted

          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>In the thirde point of this article,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>wee doe expressely declare the manner

          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>prochfull, so also was it most bitter or  
          <!--64.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>sharpe to be suffered, yet tooke he that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>kind of death upon him, that he might  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>make satisfaction for the worlde, and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>fulfill that, which from the beginning  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>was prefigured, that he should be han 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>ged on the tree. <name>Isaac</name> was layde on 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>the pile of wood to bee offered up in sa 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>crifice.  <name>Moses</name> also stuck the Serpent 
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>on the stake of wood, and lift it up to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>be beheld. And the Lord himelfe said:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/><quote>I, when I shall be lift up from the earth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>will draw all men unto me.</quote> Finally he  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>dyed on the Crosse giving up his Ghost  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>to God. For he dyed verily and in deed,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>as you shall straightway perceive.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>There I have briefely to declare unto  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>you, what the fruit of Christ his death  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>is. First we were accursed because of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>sinne: he therefore tooke our curse upon 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>himelfe, being lift up upon the Crosse,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>to the ende he might take our curse a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>way, and that we might bee blessed in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>him. Then also ye heritage bequeathed  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>to us by will, coulde not come unto  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>us, unlesse he which bequeathed it did  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>dye. But God bequeathed it: who, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>that he might die, became man and dy 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>ed according to his humane nature, to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>the end that we might receive the he 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>ritage of life.  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>In an other place againe <name>Paul</name> saith:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/><quote>Him that knewe not sinne, did God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>make sinne for us, that wee by him  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>might be made the righteousnesse of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>God.</quote> Our Lorde therefore became  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>man, by the sacrifice of himself to make  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>satisfaction for us, on whom as it were  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>upon a Goate for sinne offering, when  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>all the sinnes of the whole worlde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>were gathered together and layde, hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>by his death tooke awaie and purged 
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>them all: so that nowe the onely sacri 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>fice of Christ hath satisfied for the sins 
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>of the whole worlde. And this ve 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>rily is the greatest comodity of Christ  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>his death taught everie where by the

          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>patience, and the mortification of our

          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>was taken downe from the crosse,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>and laide in a Sepulchre. In the Gos

          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>that buried him, <name>Joseph</name> and <name>Nicode

          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>ner how they buried him. The fruite  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>of this his buriall, the saviour him 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>selfe hath taught in these wordes, <quote>Ve

          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>seede of corne cast into the earth doe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>die, it remaineth alone. But it it die, it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>bringeth foorth muth fruite.</quote> There 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>uppon the Apostle exhorteth us to bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>buried with Christ in his death, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>we may rise againe in the newnesse of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>life, yea that wee may live and raigne  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>with him for evermore. If therefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>our bodies also be buried at ame time,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>let us not therefore bee troubled in  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>minde. For the faithfull are buried,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>that they may rise with Christe a

          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>some do put severally by it selfe, for the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>fift article of our faith. I for my part 
          <!--65.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>do se no cause whie it shooulde be pluc

          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>whie it should make by it selfe a pecu 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>liar article of our faith. The wordes  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>are these: <quote>Hee descended into hell.</quote> 
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>Touching this there are sundrie opi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>nions among the expositors of the ho 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>lie Scriptures. <name>Augustine</name> in his booke  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>De fide Symbolo doeth neither place  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>these wordes in the rule of beleefe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>nor yet expound them. <name>Cyprian</name> saith  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>thus : <quote>it is to be knowne verily, that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>in the Ereede of the Latine Churth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>this is not added: Hee descended in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>to hell, nor yet is this clause received  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>in the Churches of the East: but yet  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>the sense of that clause seemeth to bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>all one with that, where it is said: He  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>was buried.</quote> This saith he.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>So then <name>Cyprians</name> opinion seemeth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>to be that, To descend into hell is no 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>thing else but to be laide in the grave,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>according to that saying of <name>Jacob</name>:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/><quote>Yee will bring my gray haires with so 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>row to hell, or the grave.</quote>  
      </p>
      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>But there are some that thinke this  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>assertion to be without lawfull proofe.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>For it is not likelie that they woulde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>wrappe a thing once alreadie plainely  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>spoken immediately after in a darker 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>kinde of speach. Nay rather so often 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>as two sentences are joyned together 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>that signifie both one thing, the latter  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>is alwayes an exposition of the first.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>But in these two speeches Hee was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>buried, and. He descended into hell, the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>first is the plainer, and the latter the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>more intricate. <name>Augustine</name> in his 99. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>Epistle to Evodius, turmoileth him 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>selfe pitifully in this matter. To  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>Dardanus de Deiprafentiain, hee writeth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>that the Lord went into hell, but that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>he felt no torment. Wee shall more  
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>agreeably to the truth seeme to under 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>stand this article, if wee shall thinke  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>that the vertue of Christ his death,  
          <!--66.xml-->
          <pb ed="#L" n="66"/>
          <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>did flow even to them that were dead,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>and profited them too : that is to say,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>that al the Patriarches and holy men 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>that died before the coming of Christ,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>were for the death of Christ preserved  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>from death everlasting. As <name>Saint  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>Peter</name> also maketh mention. <quote>That the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>Lord went in the spirite, and preached  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>into the spirites that were in prison.</quote> 
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>For verily they by the death of Christ  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>were made to knowe the sentence of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>condemnation justly pronounced a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>gainst them, because when they lived,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>they beleeved not with <name>Noe</name>, and them 
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>that were with him, in the Saviour  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>that was to come. Or else other 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>wise by the lower partes or by hell,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>we understad not the place of punish 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>ment appointed for the wicked, but the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>faithful that are departed, even as al 
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>so by the higher parts wee understand  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>them that are yet remaining alive.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>Wherefore the soule of Christ des 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>cended into bell, that is to say, it was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>caried into <name>Abrahams</name> bosome, where 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>in all the faithfull alreadie departed,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>were gathered together. Therefore  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>when he saide to the thiefe that was 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>crucified with him: This day shalt 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>thou be with mee in Paradise, he pro 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>mised him the felowship of life and of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>the belessed soules.

      <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Touching <name>Abrahams</name> bosome, our  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>Lorde spake at large in the sixteenth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>chapter of the Gospell after <name>S. Luke</name>.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>For whereas the Lord is saide to have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>descended, that commeth to passe by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>the manner of speaking. For other 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>wise it is evident by <name>Luke</name>, that <name>Abra 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>hams</name> bosome is a place severed a  
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>great way from hell, and placed by

          <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>But to enquire or reason over cu 
          <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>riously of these things, is rather the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>point of a curious foole, than of a god 
          <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>ly minded man. Wee confesse in this  
          <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>article, that the foules are immortall,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>and that they immediately after the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>bodily death, do passe to life, and that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>all the saintes from the beginning of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>the worlde being sanctified by faith  
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>through Christ, doe in Christ and by
