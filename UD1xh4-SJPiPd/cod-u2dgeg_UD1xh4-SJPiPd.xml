        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>believe, we must(I meane) say, I be

        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>Some unlearned there are which hold  
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>opinion that in this point of our con 
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>fession we should say, I believe in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>holy Church. The reason that leades  
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>them so to thinke is this, because they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>finde written in the Constantinopli

        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>from the father &amp; the sonne who toge

        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>worshipped and glorified, who spake
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>by the Prophetes in one Catholiqu,
        <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>and Apostolique Church. For these  
        <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>wordes they doe so distinguishe that  
        <!--78.xml-->
        <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
        <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>as they doe repeate out of the <unclear>premises</unclear>  
        <lb ed="#L" n="48"/> these wordes, I believe, and make  
        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>this the sense, I believe in the holie

        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>believe in one Catholique and Apo

        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>than needeth, yea and against all god 
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>linesse doe they wrest these wordes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>of the Creede. For this, In one Ca 
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>tholique and Apostolique Church, is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>not referred to the Verbe, I believe,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>but to the holy Ghost, because hee

        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>For our meaning is, and we confesse  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>that one and the same spirite did all

        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>that by nature, and our owne proper

        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>for the merit and bloud of the sonne of

        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>rites, but for the truth and mercie or  
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>grace of God. For we do plainely pro

        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>givenesse of sinnes. And the worde re 
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>mission or forgivenesse doth signifie a

        <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>forme. Ther are moreover livelie  
        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>examples of this matter, and most e 
        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>vident testimonies of the holy Scrip 
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>ture. Jonas is swallowed up of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>Whale in the Syrian sea, but the 3. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>day after hee is cast up againe alive  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>uppon the shoare out of the beastes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>entrailes, which is a token, that the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>flesh shall verily rise againe.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>Wherefore that is not hard to be be 
        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>leeved, that in the Apocalips is saide, ye  
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>The Sea casteth uppe her dead. The  
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>force of fire had no force to hurt the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>three companions of Daniel, yea the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>rage of wilde beastes (contrarie to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>nature) abstained from biting Dantel  
        <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>himselfe: What marvell is it there 
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>fore, if at this day, neither the force of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>fire, nor rage of wilde beastes, is able  
        <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>to resist the polver of God being dispo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>sed to raise his creatures up againes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>Did not our Lord Christ raise up La 
        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>Farus when he had lien three daies in  
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>the grave, yea and stancke too, to life a 
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>gaine: Did not he himelf, having once  
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>broken the tyrannie of death, rise by  
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>againe the thirde day from the deads  
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>did he not rise againe in the same sub

        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>wherein he hanged on the Crosse, and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>being taken downe from the Crosse,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>was buried: Not without good cause  
        <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>do we looke backe to Christ, which is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>called the first begotten among ye dead,

        <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>I will adde a fewe testimonies to

        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>Job confessing his faith touthing the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>resurrection of the dead in his great 
        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>weakenesse, affliction and fickenesse,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>saith: I knowe that iny redeemer li 
        <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>veth, and that in the last daie l shall 
        <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>rise out of the earth, and shall be clad 
        <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>againe with my skinne, and in my flesh

        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>vone other. This hope is layde up in  
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>my bosome. This testimonie is so e 
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>vident as that it needeth no larger an

        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>No lesse evident are those testimo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>nies out of Claie, chap26. Ezek. 37. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>Psalme 15. Math. 22. John 56.11. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>Throughout the Actes in everie place  
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>is often repeated the resurrection of ye  
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>dead. saint Paul in the 15. cha. of his  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>first Epistle to the Corinthians, doeth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>make a full discourse of this resurrec 
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>tion. In the fourth chapter of his 2. E 
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>pistle he saith: we which live are al 
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>waies delivered to death, for Jesus  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>sake, that the life of Jesus also might 
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>appeare in our mortall flesh. See now 
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>what coulde be spoken more plainely,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>than that the life of Christ shall bee  
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>made to appeare in this mortall flesh  
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>of ours: For by and by after he sayth:  
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>We knowe that he hath raised up the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>Lorde Jesus, shall raise us up also by  
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>the meanes of Jesus. And in the fifth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>chapter againe: wee must all ap 
        <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>peare before the judgement seate of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>Christ (saith he) that everie man may 
        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>receive the workes of his bodie, ac 
        <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>cording to that hee hath done, whe 
        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>ther it bee good or evill. Therefore  
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>these verie bodies of ours shall rise a

        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>that daie shall finde alive, they shal in  
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>a moment of time be chaunged, and

        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>from the first Adam to the last that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>shall die, rise uppe againe, and in their

        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>that are chaunged before the Tribu

        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>last pronounced sentence in judge 
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>ment.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>This doth Paul set downe in these  
        <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>wordes, Loe, I tell you a mysterie, we  
        <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>shall not all verily sleepe, but we shall 
        <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>all be chaunged in a moment of time  
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>in the twinckling of an eye, at the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>founde of the last trumpe: For it shall 
        <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>founde, and the dead shall rise againe  
        <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>incorruptibly, and we shall be chaun 
        <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>ged. For this corruptible must put on  
        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>incorruption, and this mortall must  
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>put on immortalitle.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>By this evident testimonie of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>Apostle, we may gather in what fa 
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>shion our bodies shall be in that resur 
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>rection: Verily our bodies shall bee  
        <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>none other in the resurrection than 
        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>now they be, this onely excepted, that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>they shal be cleane without all corrup 
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>tion, and corruptible affection. For  
        <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>the Apostle saith, The dead shall rise

        <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>And againe pointing expresly and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>precisely to these verie bodies which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>here wee beare about, he saith: This 
        <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>corruptible, This mortall, yea, This  
        <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>bodie I saie, and no other, as Job al

        <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>immortall, which before the resur

        <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>body of ours in the resurrection shalbe 
        <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>set free from all evill affections and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>passions, from all corruption: but the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>substance therof shall not bee brought  
        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>to naught, it shall not bee changed in 
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>to a spirite, it shall not loose the own  
        <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>and proper shape. And this body ve 
        <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>rily because of that purification and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>cleansing from those dregs, yea and ra 
        <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>ther because of these heavenly and di 
        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>vine gifts, is called both a spirituall  
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>body, and also a glorious and purified  
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>body,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>For Paul in the third to the Phi 
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>lippians sayth: Our conversation is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>in heaven, from whence we looke for  
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>the saviour the Lord lesus Christ, who 
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>shall chaunge our vile bodie that it  
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>maie bee made like unto his glorious  
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>body,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>See heere, the Apostle calleth not  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>our resurrection from the dead, a  
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>transubstantiation, or losse of the sub 
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>staunce of our body, but a changing:  
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>then also shewing what kinde of bo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>dy that chaunged body is, hee calleth it  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>a glorious body, not without all shape,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>and voyd of fashion, but augmented  
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>in glory : yea he setteth before us the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>very body of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>wherein hee sheweth us what fashion 
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>our bodies shall have beeyng in glory,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>For in plaine words he faith: He shal

        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>ous body,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>Let us therefore see what kind of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>body our Lord had after his resurre 
        <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>ction : it was neyther turned into  
        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>a ghost, nor brought to nothing, nor  
        <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>yet not able to be known by the shape  
        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>and figure: For shewing them his  
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>handes and feete, that were easily  
        <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>knowne by the poynt of the nayles  
        <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>wherewith hee was crucified, he said:  
        <!--87.xml-->
        <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
        <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>Sce, for I ameven hee, to wit, cladde  
        <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>againe with the same body wherein I  
        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>hung uppon the Crosse,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>For speaking yet more plainely, d  
        <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>prooving, that that bodie of his, was 
        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>not a spirituall substaunce, hee saide:  
        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>A spirite hath not fleshe and bones as  
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>yee see that I have. Hee hath there 
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>fore a purified body, flesh and bones  
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>and the very same memders which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>hee had when as yet his body was not 
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>purified. And for this cause, did the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>same Lorde offer to Thomas his side,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>and the scarres of his five woundes,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>to bee felt and handled, to the end,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>that wee shoulde not doubt, but that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>his very body was raysed up agayne,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>Hee did both eate aud drinke with his  
        <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>Disciples , as Peter in the Acts wit 
        <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>nesseth before Cornelius, that al men 
        <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>might knowe, that the very selfe  
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>same body, that died, rose from death  
        <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>agayne.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>Now although this body bee com 
        <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>prehended within a certaine lyiited  
        <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>place, not dispersed all over and everie  
        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>where, although it have a just quan 
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>tity, sigure, or shape, and a just weight  
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>with the owne kinde and nature, yet  
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>not withstanding it is free from every  
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>passion, corruption and infirmitye. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>For the body of the Lorde once ray 
        <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>sed uppe, was in the Gardeyne, and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>not in the Sepulchre, when the wo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>men came to annoynt it, it meeteth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>them by the waye as they returue  
        <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>from the Sepulchre, and offereth it  
        <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>selfe to beeseene of Magdalene in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>Gardeine : it goeth in companie to E 
        <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>maus, with the two Disciples that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>iourneyed to Emaus: in the meane  
        <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>time while hee was with them in bo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>dy, hee was not among the other Dis 
        <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>ciples: when they twayne are retur 
        <lb ed="#L" n="91"/>ned to the eleven, the Lord himelfe at  
        <lb ed="#L" n="92"/>evening is present with them: He  
        <!--88.xml-->
        <pb ed="#L" n="88"/>
        <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
        <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>goeth before his Disciples into Gali 
        <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>le : presently after hee commeth into  
        <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>Jurie againe, where his body was ta 
        <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>ken up from mount Olivet into heave.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>All this doth proove the certaine veri 
        <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>tie of Christ his bodie. But because  
        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>this bodie (although it be a true and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>very body of the owne proper kind,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>place, disposition, and of the owne pro 
        <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>per shape, and nature) is called a glo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>rified and glorious bodie, I will saie  
        <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>somewhat of that glory, which verily  
        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>is incident to the true shape and sub 
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>stance of the body once raised uppe a 
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>gaine.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>First glory in this sense is used for  
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>a lightsomnesse and shining bright 
        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>nesse. For Paul saith, that the children 
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>of Israel for the glory of Moses coun 
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>tenance, coulde not beholde with their  
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>eies the face of Moses : so then a glo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>rious body is a bright and shining bo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>dy. A very good proofe of this did our  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>Lord shew, even a little before his re 
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>surrection, whe it pleased him to give 
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>to his Disciples a small taste of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>glory to come, and for that cause took a 
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>side certaine whom he had chosen into  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>the top of a certaine hil, where he was 
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>transsigured before them, so that the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>fashion of his countenance did shine as  
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>the sunne, and his clothes were white  
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>&amp; glistered as the light. The Lord veri 
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>ly had stil the same bodily substance, &amp;  
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>the same members of the body, but 
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>they we re transeigured.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>But it is manifest, that that transfi 
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>guratio was in ye accidents: For light  
        <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>and brightnesse was added, so that the

        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>and bodie remayning as it was, the

        <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>whereby also he did eate with his dis

        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>bodies neede not foode or nourishment  
        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>at all : yet neverthelesse his bodie shi 
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>neth nowe in Heaven, as John in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>first of the Apocalipse witnesseth, and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>the sacred Scriptures laye an allured  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>hope before us, that even our bodies  
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>also shall in the resurrection bee like 
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>wise clarified. For the Lorde himelfe  
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>in the Gospell alleadging the wordes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>of Daniel, saith: Then shall the righ 
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>teous shine as the Sonne in his fathers 
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>kingdome. For this cause the glori 
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>ous bodies are called also clarified of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>the clearnesse of that heavenly bright 
        <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>nesse, wherewith they glister and are  
        <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>adorned.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>Secondarily, glorie and vilenesse  
        <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>are made contraries. For Paul saith,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>Hee shall chaunge our vile bodie, to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>make it in fashion like ro his glorious  
        <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>bodie. In these wordes, Vilenesse and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>Glorie, are set the one agaynst the o 
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>ther. Vilenesse comprehendeth the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>whole packe of miseries and infirmi 
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>ties, passions and affections, which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>for sinne was layde uppon the bodie,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>From all which our bodies are pur 
        <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>ged in the resurrection of life: so that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>then the glorious bodies are bodies  
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>dreined from the dregges of all cor 
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>ruption, passions and infirmities, and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>clad with eternitie, heavenlie feeling  
        <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>and glorie. For the Apostle saith: It is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>sowen in corruption, itriseth in in 
        <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>corruption: it is sowen in dishonour,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>it riseth in glorie: it is sowen in infir 
        <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>mitie, it riseth in poler : it is sowen a  
        <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>naturall bodie, it tiseth a spiritual bo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>die.  The giftes therefore of the glo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="91"/>rious &amp; clarified bodies are very great 
        <lb ed="#L" n="92"/>and manye, as incorruption, glorie,

        <cb ed="#L" n="a"/>
        <lb ed="#L" n="1"/>polver and the quickening spirite. For  
        <lb ed="#L" n="2"/>the Apostle himselfe shewing what he  
        <lb ed="#L" n="3"/>meant by ye naturall &amp; spirituall body,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="4"/>addeth this immediatly &amp; saith: There  
        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>is a naturalll bodye, and there is a spiri 
        <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>tuall bodie : as it is written. The first  
        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>man Adam was made a living soule,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>and the last Adam was made a dure 
        <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>kening spirite. And yet agayne more  
        <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>plainely he sayth: Howbeit that is not 
        <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>first which is spirituall, but that which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>is naturall, and then that which is spy 
        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>rituall. The first man is of the earth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>earthly:the second man is the Lord from  
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>heaven. As is the earthly, suth are they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>that are earthly: fas is the heavenly,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>suth are they also that are heavenlie,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>And as we have born the image of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>earthly, so shal wee beare the image of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>the heavenlie.  So then Paul calleth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>that naturall bodie and earthly body,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>which wee have of our first father A 
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>dam, whose quickening is of the soule  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>and by it doeth live. And hee calleth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>the spiritual body, and heavenly body,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>which wee have of Christ, and made  
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>to the likenesse of the body of Christ,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>which although it bee a very body in  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>deede, and the fleshe thereof bee very 
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>flesh indeed, yet notwithstanding it is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>quickened &amp; preserved by the spirit of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>Christ, and needeth not any polver be 
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>getative.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>Although therefore these very bo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>dies &amp; memders which now we heare  
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>shall after the resurrection be in Hea 
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>ven, yet neverthelesse because they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>are clarified and cleansed from all cor 
        <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>ruption, and feeling of the natural bo

        <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>nor use of the carnall body and mem 
        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>bers. And this doth the Lorde affirme  
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>agaynst the Sadduces that breamed  
        <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>of marriages in Heaven, or rather by

        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>and give in marriage: but they that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>shal be thought worthie of that world  
        <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>and of the resurreetion from the dead 
        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>doe neither marrie wives, nor give in  
        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>marriage: neither can they die anie  
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>more. For they are equall to the An 
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>gels, and are the sonnes of God, assoone  
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>as they be the sonnes of resurrection.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>To which effect also Paul saythr Vlesh.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>and bloud can not inherite the king 
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>dome of GOD. And least peradven

        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>words, and thinke that he spake of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>substance of the flesh, he addeth imme 
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>diatly this for interpretation therof, &amp;  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>saith, Neither shall corruption inherit  
        <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>incorruption. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>Wherefore flesh &amp; bloud, that is to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>saye, the affections and lustes of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>fleshe, shall not bee in the Clect that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>live in heaven. For the ioyes of Hea

        <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>ioyes of the earth, &amp; are so farre foorth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>of another condition, that they cannot  
        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>admit such corrupt creatures to be in 
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>heritours of them, &amp; for that cause the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>corruptible bodies must first be purged 
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>from all corruption, &amp; by that meanes,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>purely clarified. The Turkes therfore  
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>are deceyved that looke for earthly  
        <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>ioyes,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>Moreover the bodies of the wicked  
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>shall also rise againe. For Paul in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>Actes saith: I beleeve all that is writ 
        <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>ten in the Lawe and the Prophetes  
        <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>hoping in God that the resurrection

        <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>and uniust. See heere, the Apostle saith

        <lb ed="#L" n="5"/>mentes, and in death and corruption 
        <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>shall neither die nor yet corrupt : that 
        <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>even as on earth are found certayne  
        <lb ed="#L" n="8"/>bodies that doe indure even in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>fire, so the cursed bodies of the wicked  
        <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>shal not be worne out nor broken with  
        <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>any torments whatsoever, for every

        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>ments for ever and ever and without  
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>all end. For the Lorde in the Gospell  
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>sayeth, They that have done evill  
        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>shall rise agayne to the resurreetion of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>damnation, that is, to an induring &amp; 
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>everlasting damnation. And Daniel  
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>before him sayde, And the multitude  
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>of them that sleepe in the dust of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>earth shall awake, some to everlasting  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>life, and some to shame and perpetual  
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>contempt. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>And in the Gospell agayne, the Lord  
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>sayeth: Their worme dieth not, and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>their fire is not duenched. And the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>very same wordes used Elay before  
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>him in his 66. Chapter. Tee must  
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>alwayes therefore have that saying  
        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>of the Lorde in our hearts, Jeare him  
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>that can destroy both the body ethe

        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>ching the resurrection of the flesh.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>The last Article of our belief, which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>with good lucke shutteth up the rest, is  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>this, And life everlasting. Wee have

        <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
        <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>fore in our confession we say: And life)

        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>shall have life, and live for ever both  
        <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>in body &amp; soule. And that everlasting  
        <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>nesse verily is perpetual &amp; hath no end,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>as a little before is proved out of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>holy Scriptures.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>Moreover, the foules are made par 
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>takers of this eternall life immediat 
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>ly after they are departed out of the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>bodies, as the Lord himselfe witnes 
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>seth saying, Te that beleeveth in the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>Sonne of GOD shall not come into  
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>judgement, but hath escaped from 
        <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>death to life.  As for the bodies they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>are buried and doe putrifie, and yet so  
        <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>notwitstanding, that they shal not bee  
        <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>without life for ever. But they shal 
        <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>then at length be received into eter 
        <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>nall life, when beeing raysed up, they  
        <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>shall after: the time of judgement bee  
        <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>caught into the ayre, there to meete  
        <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>Christ that they may forever bee with  
        <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>the Lorde. For then doe the foules re 
        <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>turne Sit of heaven every one to his  
        <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>owne hgdie, that the whole, perfect, &amp;  
        <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>fil man may live for ever both in soule  
        <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>and body. For the soule of Christ dy 
        <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>ing on the Crosse did out of hand de 
        <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>part into Paradise, and the thirde  
        <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>day after returned to the body, which  
        <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>rose againe and ascended into heaven.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>Even as therfore, eternal life came to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>the head Christ, so shall it also come to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>al and every membder of Christ,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>Now, whereas Paul citing Clay,

        <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>triarches, Prophetes, Apostles, Mar 
        <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>tyrs, our Fathers, all nations, all the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>hoast of Heaven, and lastly the whole  
        <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>divine and heavenlie glorie. Most  
        <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>truely therefore sayde Aurelius Au 
        <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>gustine, Lib, de Eivit. Dei. 22. Cap. 29. 
        <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>when it is demaunded of mee what 
        <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>the Saintes shall doe in that spirituall  
        <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>bodie3. J aunswere not that which I  
        <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>nowesee, but that that l beleeve. I say 
        <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>therefore that they shall see God in  
        <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>that spirituall bodie. And againe, If 
        <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>I should saie the trueth, I knowe not 
        <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>in what sorte that action, duietnesse  
        <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>and rest shall be. For the peace of  
        <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>God doth passe all understanding.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>To be short, we shall see God face to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>face, we shall be silled with the com 
        <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>panie of God, and yet be never wearie

        <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>of him. And the face of God is not that  
        <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>countonaunce that appeareth in us,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>but is a most delectable revealing and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>inioying of God, which no mortall  
        <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>tongue can worthily declare. Goe to  
        <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>then (dearely beloved brethren) let us  
        <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>believe and live, that when wee shall 
        <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>depart from hence wee may in verie  
        <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>deede have triall of those uuspeakable  
        <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>ioyes of the eternal life to come, which I 
        <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>nowe we doe believe.  
        <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>Hitherto have I throughout the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>foure last Articles declared unto you  
        <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>the fruite and ende of Christian faith,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>Faith leaneth upon one God the Fa 
        <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>ther, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>which sanctifieth ye faithfull, &amp; purgeth  
        <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>and halloweth a Church to him elfe,  
        <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>which Church hath a communion 
        <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>with God and all saintes. All the  
        <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>offences of which Church God pardo 
        <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>neth and forgiveth. And doeth pre 
        <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>serue it both soule and bodie. For as  
        <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>the saints soules can not die, so God 
        <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>rayseth up their bodies againe , and  
        <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>maketh them glorious and everla 
        <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>staing, to the end that the whole man  
        <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>may for ever live in heaven, with.   
        <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>the Lord: to whom be praise
