          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>enterprising to set up the toppe of the

          <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>and thereby we understand that it is 
          <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>not necessary for the church: yea wee

          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>Apostles of Christ have saide nothing 
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>thereof. Moreover experience teacheth 
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>that the state &amp; condition of the weake

          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>to our life and salvation. Yea, the Di

          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>that whole externall discipline and in

          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>For in old time those ceremonies we
