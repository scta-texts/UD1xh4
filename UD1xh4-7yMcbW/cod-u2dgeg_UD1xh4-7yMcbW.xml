          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>things but a few true 
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>ly, which are to bee ex

          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>ly beloved) the which 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>partely appertayne to the instituti 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>on of the Ecclesiasticall ministerie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>and preservation thereof, there are 
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>partelie certaine percular ordinaun 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>ces of the Church which the Church  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>can not want. Whereof in this last 
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>Sermon of this Decade, so farre 
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>as the Lorde shall give mee grace to 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>speake, I intende as briefly as I can 
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>to intreate. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>First of all we must know that the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>Lorde our God hath not burdened his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>church with over manie lawes &amp; in 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>stitutions, but hath let downe a fewe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>easily to be numbered, &amp; those not costly,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>nor intricate, nor long, but profitable, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>simple, plaine and short. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>In time past, when as under the law 
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>the Lord appointed unto the people a 
          <lb ed="#L" n="35"/>costly and sumptuous worshipping of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>him, not withstanding al things there 
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>in were certaine, numerable, and mo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>derate: neyther woulde he have anie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>thing added to, or taken from it at the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>pleasure of men, or to bee otherwise b 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>led than he had appointed.

          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>Who then will thinke, that after 
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>the abrogating of the Lawe, the Lord 
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>would deliver unto the Church of his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>new people, a sumptuous and an infi 
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>nite discipline? Wherefore it is partly 
          <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>the couetousnesse of the Pastours and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>estates of the Church, and partly the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>monstrous superstition of the common 
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>people, that hath made everie thing for 
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>sumptuous, and infinite in the church. 
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>Let us sticke unto this, that the Lord 
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>our GOD hath instituted in his 
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>Church, but verie fewe thinges, and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>such as are necessarie: and therefore 
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>we ought all to indeavour, that the 
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>church be not over-burdened with tra 
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>ditions and institutions, which procee 
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>ded not from GOD himselfe. The 
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>Church of God is gorgeously enough 
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>decked and furnished, if she retaine and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>keep the institutions of her God and 
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>Lorde.

          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>of the Godlinesse of the Church of

          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>by reason of the Philosophy Levits,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>were called Leviticall. For hee had 
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>consecrated all the Leviticall Tribe,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>unto the Priesthood and to studies: 
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>Not for that it was not also lawful for  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>Gentlemen of other Tribes to studie 
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>Philosophie or wisedome: but because  
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>the Levites were peculiarlie appoin

          <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>likewise were called Leviticall and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>Priestly, not that Preists onely dwelt

          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>delighted in darkenesse, and in the

          <lb ed="#L" n="7"/>spirituall thinges, is it a greate mat

          <lb ed="#L" n="9"/>Hee therfore thinketh that the Corin

          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>their temporall things, namely, if they  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>be compared with eternal good things,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>which the ministers doe bring by tea

          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>excelleth the body, by so much more are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>spirituall thinges better than tempo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>rall. The Apostle also concealeth an  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>evident argument in these woordes,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>where he admonisheth that it is meete  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>that hee that soweth should also reape.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>In this point also is great inequality,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>in that the ministers sowe the better,

          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>the Lord instituted his ordinance con

          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>the deede, and another of the right of ye,

          <lb ed="#L" n="6"/>so farre forth as honest necessity requi

        </p>
        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="10"/>In times past the seconde parte of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="11"/>ecclesiasticall goods was allotted unto  
          <lb ed="#L" n="12"/>clearkes. And clearkes are the harvest  
          <lb ed="#L" n="13"/>of Pastors, studious of divinity , and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="14"/>wholly disposed to the holy ministery.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="15"/>And forasmuch as these have dedica 
          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>ted theselves and all that they have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>wholly to the Church &amp; the ministerie

          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>be nourished &amp; mainteined by the costs  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>of the Church. But it is convenient  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>they be nourished meanly, who ought  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>to be an example of meave and thrifty

          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>For to bee brought up delicately,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>doth nothing agree with the ministe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>ries of the Church. And therefore, <name>A 
          <lb ed="#L" n="27"/>mos</name> founde fault that the Nazarites  
          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>dranke wine, for that he meant that 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>drunkardes did not mainteine the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>church, but utterly destroy it. Of which  
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>matter wee spake in another place,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>Moreover, it is fit that due portions be

          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>and fulfilled the figures. For as before

          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>that the Patriarches did ever build a

          <lb ed="#L" n="28"/>For God misliketh that foolish &amp; mad 
          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>kinde of buildinges, not much unlike

          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>enterprising to set up the toppe of the

          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>who without all riot doth gather his

          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>hath taught both sparingnesse and the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>contempt of al riot. A Church is large  
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>and bigge enough, it it be sufficient to  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>receive al that belong unto it. For the

          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>also, it is allowed by the holy use of it.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>For in the temple the holy Churche of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="54"/>God is gathered together:the true and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>most blessed word of God is also decla 
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>red in the temple: the holy Sacramets  
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>of God are received in the temple: and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>also in the temple prayers are powred  
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>foorth to God which are most accepta

        </p>
        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>Verily the place of it selfe is no

          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>things are done in that place in respect  
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>that they are done there, the place it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>selfe is called holy. Therefore not with 
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>out great cause ought all prophanati 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>on and filthines be farre from the holy  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>temple of the Lorde. The Senatours  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>court or seat of judgemet is accounted  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>so holy a thing, that whosoever either  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>in word or deedeused himselfe unreve 
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>rently towardes it, should be accused  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>of treason. And yet in this court the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>Senators onely are gathered and as 
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>sembled together, to heare the matters  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>of suiters in thinges transitory that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>shall passe away and perish. By how  
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>much the more then ought reverence  
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>to bee given unto temples, into the

          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>of God, and to receive his holy sacra 
          <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>ments: And therefore as we hate and  
          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>abandon all superstition in temples,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>so we love not the prophanation of

          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>at these dayes are unto us, as in olde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>time trumpets were unto the people of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="18"/>God For they serve to cal the congre
          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>gatio together, and they are numbred 
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>among tokens and warnings. About  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>bels there is a wonderful superstition.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="22"/>They are christened by bishops: and it  
          <lb ed="#L" n="23"/>is thought ye they have power to put 
          <lb ed="#L" n="24"/>away any great tempest. In the olde  
          <lb ed="#L" n="25"/>time men were stirred up to prayer by  
          <lb ed="#L" n="26"/>the ringing of them, what time any

          <lb ed="#L" n="29"/>cratio seemeth to have a peculiar kind  
          <lb ed="#L" n="30"/>of vertue in it. Who can but marvel 
          <lb ed="#L" n="31"/>and be astonied at this extreme blind 
          <lb ed="#L" n="32"/>nesse? Moreover they use belles to be 
          <lb ed="#L" n="33"/>wayle the dead. Al which things are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="34"/>superstitious, and , utterly to bee con

        </p>
        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="36"/>For so much as the true use of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="37"/>church goods consisteth in those things  
          <lb ed="#L" n="38"/>which we reckoned up before, it follo 
          <lb ed="#L" n="39"/>weth that the abuse therof must needs  
          <lb ed="#L" n="40"/>be in the rotraries, whether we do of 
          <lb ed="#L" n="41"/>fend in one kind or in many. Justice &amp;  
          <lb ed="#L" n="42"/>equity is to be kept in these as well as  
          <lb ed="#L" n="43"/>in all other things.

        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="44"/>We ought not to take from one ma 
          <lb ed="#L" n="45"/>&amp; give to another, but wee must give  
          <lb ed="#L" n="46"/>unto every one that which is his own.  
          <!--1128.xml-->
          <cb ed="#L" n="b"/>
          <lb ed="#L" n="47"/>Therefore we may not take any thing  
          <lb ed="#L" n="48"/>from the poore and give it to the mini 
          <lb ed="#L" n="49"/>sters of ye church : neither is their por 
          <lb ed="#L" n="50"/>tion and necessaries to be taken from 
          <lb ed="#L" n="51"/>them, that the poore may live thereof.  
          <lb ed="#L" n="52"/>The holy scripture giveth one portion  
          <lb ed="#L" n="53"/>of the church goods to the ministers of

          <lb ed="#L" n="55"/>willeth us to give unto the poore their  
          <lb ed="#L" n="56"/>part. Therefore if bishops or ministers  
          <lb ed="#L" n="57"/>of the Church do challenge unto them 
          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>selves all the church goods, &amp; give not

        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>If the ministers do not challege un

          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>&amp; yet doe take unjustly more than ey

          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>of God and the Apostles doth allowe:  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>or else if they spende unthriftily that  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>portion due unto the, they grievously  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>offende. But they sinne greatly, yea, 
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>most horribly if they wast the goodes  
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>of the poore, in hunting, dicing, drin 
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>king and ryoting, whore hunting, or  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>else in warrefare, and in the meane

        </p>
        <p>
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>But if a just and good portion fall  
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>unto the poore, perhaps there will bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>a fault in this poynt, in the Steward

          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>there is also great offence committed

          <lb ed="#L" n="16"/>onely I doe adde at this present time,  
          <lb ed="#L" n="17"/>that there ought to bee no odious con

          <lb ed="#L" n="19"/>matter, but that in this and other such  
          <lb ed="#L" n="20"/>like cases, discipline with charitie is  
          <lb ed="#L" n="21"/>constantly to bee observed. For it be

          <lb ed="#L" n="58"/>pray you will say that hee is free from  
          <lb ed="#L" n="59"/>discipline, whom the Lord would have  
          <lb ed="#L" n="60"/>altogether subject and bounde unto it?  
          <lb ed="#L" n="61"/>Against the commaundement of God 
          <lb ed="#L" n="62"/>there is no Popes lawe, no priviledge  
          <lb ed="#L" n="63"/>of king or Emperour of force. For no  
          <lb ed="#L" n="64"/>man can abrogate the decree of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="65"/>high God. And the Lord commandeth  
          <lb ed="#L" n="66"/>to warne and correct every brother 
          <lb ed="#L" n="67"/>that doth amisse : therefore would hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="68"/>have us also sharpely to admonishe  
          <lb ed="#L" n="69"/>the ministers of the churches that are  
          <lb ed="#L" n="70"/>negligent and go astray. Truely he  
          <lb ed="#L" n="71"/>himselfe did often and very sharpely  
          <lb ed="#L" n="72"/>reprove the whole order of the Priests  
          <lb ed="#L" n="73"/>of the church of Hierusalem. Helie the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="74"/>Lords priest is ill reported of in ye holie  
          <lb ed="#L" n="75"/>Scripture for that hee brideled not his  
          <lb ed="#L" n="76"/>sonnes beeing Priestes, with sharper 
          <lb ed="#L" n="77"/>discipline. Wee reade howe the pro 
          <lb ed="#L" n="78"/>phets of the Lord blamed very bitter 
          <lb ed="#L" n="79"/>ly all the Colledges of Priests, and the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="80"/>high Priests also. Examples are to bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="81"/>founde in every place throughout the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="82"/>holy history, and in the writings of the  
          <lb ed="#L" n="83"/>Prophets. Yea, <name>Saynt Paul</name> repro 
          <lb ed="#L" n="84"/>ved <name>the most holy Apostle saint Pe 
          <lb ed="#L" n="85"/>ter</name> at Antioch in Syria in the sight of  
          <lb ed="#L" n="86"/>the whole Congregation, for that hee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="87"/>taught not directly according to ye pre 
          <lb ed="#L" n="88"/>script rule of the Gospell. And to bee  
          <lb ed="#L" n="89"/>short, Christ himself in the revelation  
          <lb ed="#L" n="90"/>which was made to <name>S. John the Apo
